# SafeRest
This was made as the final project for the second year of the CTeSP DTAM course from ESMAD.

The project goal was to develop an Android App, using React Native, with a COVID related theme. Me and my group friend decided to create an app that would inform restaurant customers about the lotation of a restaurant in real time.

Important Notice - The App supports 3 types of users: Client, Restaurant Manager/Owner or Admin

Features:

- Search for the restaurants on a map, either from a direct input on a search bar or just by dragging the map around. (Requires geolocation, so that the base location is the one from the user);
- Check restaurant infos (ie: Real time Capacity, address, phone number...);
- Create restaurant page;
- Edit restaurant page info;
- Comment on restaurant pages;
- Check your profile and see your comments;

> The restaurant capacity counting is made with use of a motion sensor, that communicates the data to the App's database API, which was also built by us.
